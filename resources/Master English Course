Become a Fluent English Speaker: A Comprehensive Guide
This guide is designed for adult learners who already speak English well but want to polish their accent, pronunciation, and usage. Each chapter focuses on a common challenge for non-native speakers. Every chapter has two sections: a Learning Section with explanations and examples, and an Exercises section for practice. The tone is friendly and clear, with short paragraphs and bullet points to help you follow along easily.
Chapter 1: Mastering the “TH” Sound
Learning Section
Pronouncing the English “TH” (as in think or this) is tricky for many learners because this sound doesn’t exist in many other languages[1]. English has two “TH” sounds: a voiceless one (as in think or thin) and a voiced one (as in this or they). Here’s how to make them:
•	Voiceless “TH” (/θ/) – Stick the tip of your tongue out slightly between your top and bottom teeth (so you can just see your tongue in the mirror) and blow air out[2]. Do not use your voice (no vocal cord vibration)[2]. It’s similar to an F sound, but with your tongue between your teeth instead of your lip[3][4]. Example words: think, athlete, north. If you do it right, “think” shouldn’t sound like “fink” or “sink.”
•	Voiced “TH” (/ð/) – Place your tongue between your teeth the same way, but use your voice (vibrate your vocal cords)[5]. You’ll feel a buzz in your throat for a voiced TH. Example words: this, other, breathe. If you do it right, “this” shouldn’t sound like “dis” or “zis.” Both TH sounds use the same tongue position; the only difference is voicing[5].
Common problems: Many learners replace /θ/ (voiceless TH) with /s/ or /t/ (“think” → sink or tink), and /ð/ (voiced TH) with /d/ or /z/ (“this” → dis or zis). The key is to always stick that tongue out slightly. A helpful tip: pretend you’re playfully sticking your tongue out, then gently hold it between your teeth while making the sound[6].
Exercises
•	Minimal Pairs: Practice these word pairs to hear the difference:
•	thin vs. sin ( thin vs sin )
•	three vs. tree
•	mouth vs. mouse
•	then vs. den
•	breathe vs. breeze
•	Tongue Twisters: Slowly say the following sentences, focusing on the TH sounds (use a mirror to check your tongue):
•	“There are thirty-three thick threads.” – Make sure your tongue comes out for every th.[7]
•	“I thought a thought, but the thought I thought wasn’t the thought that I’d thought.” – A classic TH tongue twister[8].
•	“Three thieves threw thirteen things on Thursday.” – Emphasize each th sound clearly.
•	Sentence Practice: Read these out loud:
•	“Thank you for everything.” (voiceless TH in thank, thing; voiced TH in everything)
•	“This is the best theater in the city.” (voiced th in this, the; voiceless in theater)
•	“Both of those paths lead north.” (voiceless th in both, north; voiced in those)
Repeat these exercises daily. Remember to see your tongue each time you say a TH sound. With practice, you’ll feel more confident – even many native speakers find TH challenging[1][9], so keep at it!
Chapter 2: The English “R” Sound
Learning Section
The English “R” sound (as in red or far) is notoriously difficult for many learners. Unlike the rolling R in languages like Spanish or the guttural R in French, the English R is a smooth, almost vowel-like consonant (a “liquid” consonant)[10]. Here’s how to pronounce it:
•	Tongue position: Raise the back of your tongue so the sides of it lightly touch your upper back teeth, while the middle of your tongue dips slightly down[11]. The tip of your tongue should NOT touch the roof of your mouth or your teeth[11]. (This is different from an L sound, where the tongue tip does touch the ridge behind your teeth.) Your tongue will feel tense and slightly curled back, but not curled so much that it touches anywhere.
•	Lip shape: Purse your lips into a tight “O” shape as you say R[12]. You might notice your lips rounding (especially for words like red or round).
•	Sound: Push your voice through with your tongue in that position. The air flows around your tongue, not straight out, because your tongue is changing the air path[10]. Unlike rolled R’s, do not trill or tap your tongue; it stays in the “bunched” position.
Common problems: Learners often make two mistakes with R: 1. Substituting another sound: Some replace R with a W sound (especially if they find R hard). For example, “right” might come out as “wight.” To avoid this, remember that for W your lips round but your tongue stays down, whereas for R your tongue rises in the back. Compare red vs wed – the R requires the tongue up and not touching, the W does not[13][14]. 2. Trilling or tapping: Speakers of languages with a rolled R (like rr in Spanish or Italian) might roll their tongue. English R is never rolled in standard accents – focus on keeping the tongue steady and not hitting the roof of your mouth.
Tip: It might help to glide into the R from a vowel. For instance, say “ahhh” and then slide your tongue into the R position – “ah-r”. Also, practice minimal pairs that contrast R with other sounds (like W or L) to train your ear: - rose vs woes (R vs W) - rock vs lock (R vs L)
Exercises
•	R vs W Minimal Pairs: Practice to ensure you’re not accidentally saying W:
•	right vs white
•	ray vs way
•	road vs woad (nonsense word, but helps practice)
•	read vs weed
Say them out loud. Feel how “right” requires your tongue lifted inside (no lip contact with teeth), whereas “white” has the lips doing more work and the tongue staying lower[14].
•	R vs L Minimal Pairs: Many learners (for example, Japanese speakers) confuse R and L:
•	river vs liver
•	light vs right
•	fly vs fry
•	clap vs crap (be careful with this pair in polite company!)
Focus on L by touching the ridge behind your teeth with your tongue (as you’ll learn in the next chapter), versus R by keeping the tongue back and not touching.
•	Word Practice: Start words with R (to practice the strong R sound):
•	red, run, rain, robot, rabbit, really
Then practice words ending with R (which some non-natives drop or over-pronounce): - car, far, door, flower, teacher
Make sure you still make a little R sound at the end (unless you’re imitating a British accent that drops R’s at the end of words, but in general American/International English, pronounce it).
•	Sentence Practice: Read aloud, emphasizing R:
•	“Robert rarely arrives early.” (several R’s to practice)
•	“I really appreciate your help.”
•	“Her car is near the red garage.”
If R is challenging, practice daily in front of a mirror. Remember: tongue up, not touching; lips round; no throat vibration other than voicing. It may feel unnatural at first, but with time it will become easier. Many students get a better R by using the “middle of the tongue up, tip slightly back” position[15][11] – experiment with what works for you.
Chapter 3: Perfecting the “L” Sound
Learning Section
English “L” comes in two flavors: a “light L” (at the start of words) and a “dark L” (at the end of words). Mastering both is important for a clear accent[16][17].
•	Light L (Initial L): Occurs at the beginning of words or syllables (e.g. love, light, hello). To make this sound, touch the tip of your tongue to the ridge just behind your upper front teeth (the alveolar ridge)[18][19]. It’s a quick, clean sound. The middle and back of your tongue stay low, and air flows around the sides of your tongue[20]. Your lips are relatively neutral (not rounded). For a light L, you can even let your tongue tip peek out a tiny bit between your teeth when starting the sound[19], but it usually stays just behind the teeth. Example words: love, lamp, alive.
•	Dark L (Final or “velarized” L): Occurs at the end of words or syllables (e.g. ball, table, world) or before a consonant (old, help). Here, the L has a slightly different quality. You still lift your tongue tip toward the area behind your teeth – but often the tip might not fully touch or just lightly touches. More importantly, the back of your tongue rises toward the soft palate, giving a darker or “ull” sound[21]. You may feel a bit of tension in your tongue/throat with a dark L[22]. Try saying “all” [ɔːl] – notice how your tongue’s back arches up. Also, do not round your lips for dark L; keep them neutral or even spread in a slight smile[23]. If you round your lips, it might sound like a “w” or “o” (for instance, some learners say “ball” like “bao” or “baw”)[24]. Example words: fall, school, until.
Common problems: - Substituting L with W or Y: Children or learners sometimes say “wove” instead of “love”, or “yike” instead of “like”. This happens if the tongue doesn’t reach up and the lips or a y-sound take over[25][26]. To fix it, practice exaggerating the tongue touch: really hit that ridge behind the teeth for L. - Dropping or vowel-izing dark L: In some accents (or for some learners), “ball” might sound like “bah” or “bao”, as if the L isn’t fully formed (the tongue might not rise at the end)[27]. To avoid this, practice adding a tiny neutral vowel “uh” before the L when training: say “ball” like “ba-uhl” slowly[28], making sure your tongue tip goes up. Then shorten it to the normal pronunciation.
Tips: - For light L, smile slightly to ensure you’re not rounding lips. Say “la-la-la” clearly, touching your tongue to the roof each time. - For dark L, try the “add a vowel” trick: if “table” is hard, say “ta-buhl” slowly[24][29] to train your tongue, then smooth it out. - You can also watch yourself: your tongue tip should be visible behind your top teeth for an L (especially light L) – if you’re making a W by mistake, your lips would cover it.
Exercises
•	Light L practice: Start these words slowly, making sure your tongue hits just behind your teeth:
•	lip, love, land, lemon, yellow (note “yellow” has a Y sound then L – ensure you do both: /jɛ-L-/).
•	light, laughter, later, alive, melon*.
Now put them in a short sentence: “Lucy loves lemon lollypops.” (Make a clear L each time without rounding lips.)
•	Dark L practice: Practice words ending in L:
•	tall, ball, school, peel, until, beautiful.
For each, make sure you don’t release your tongue with a vowel after L. It might help to hold the L position for half a second at the end. Try: “The ball is small.” or “It’s a full bowl.” – ensure “full” doesn’t become “fu-o”.
Another set with L before a consonant: - milk (L before K), cold (L before D), silk, help.
Say: “Please help me with that cold milk.” – focus on hitting the L in each.
•	L vs R minimal pairs: to ensure you distinguish them:
•	long vs wrong
•	clap vs crap
•	collect vs correct
These are tricky! Practice slowly: “I collect coins.” vs “I correct coins.” Listen for the L (tongue touch, clear) vs R (tongue back, different quality).
•	Sentences:
•	“Lee will call Liam later.” (Many light L’s – tongue touches each time.)
•	“I fell and hurt my ankle while climbing the hill.” (Multiple dark L sounds – fell, ankle, while, hill – try to vocalize the L quality in each.)
•	“Let’s solve the puzzle.” (Notice solve has a dark L before v: make sure it’s present.)
By practicing both types of L, you’ll start to naturally use the correct tongue position in different words. It may feel like a small detail, but mastering L will make your speech much clearer. Keep your tongue active and you’ll get the hang of it!
Chapter 4: Differentiating V and W Sounds
Learning Section
The English “V” and “W” sounds often cause confusion because they’re close in spelling but very different in pronunciation. For example, learners might mix up “vine” and “wine” or “very” and “wary”. Here’s how to get them right:
•	V (/v/ sound): This is a voiced labiodental fricative – which sounds fancy but just means: touch your top teeth to your bottom lip and let air hiss out, using your voice[30]. It’s exactly like an F sound but with voice added. You should feel your bottom lip vibrate under your top teeth[30]. Try it: say “vvvv” – you’ll feel a buzzing on your lip. Example words: van, save, love. The key is that there is contact between lip and teeth for V, and a continuous air flow.
•	W (/w/ sound): This is a voiced labiovelar approximant, which means: do NOT bite your lip at all. Instead, round your lips as if about to whistle or say “oo,” and push the sound out with your lips rounding and your tongue high in the back (approaching the /u/ position)[31]. There is no friction like V; it’s a smoother sound, almost like a quick vowel. Try it: say “wow” – your lips start rounded for the W. Example words: we, well, window. For W, both lips are used (they come closer together in a small circle) and no part of your lip touches your teeth[31].
Common problems: - Some learners (for example, from Indian or German backgrounds) might pronounce W and V similarly. Germans often pronounce English W as a V sound (because in German that’s how it works), so “warm” may sound like “varm.” On the other hand, some learners overshoot and turn every V into a W, so “very well” might sound like “wery well.” - Spanish speakers sometimes pronounce V like B (since in Spanish “vaca” sounds like “baca”). So “vest” might sound like “best.”
To correct these: - Always think of V as an “F” with voice. If you can say “fine” but not “vine,” practice by substituting: start with “ffffine” then add voice “vvvine.” Feel that lip-teeth contact. - Think of W as an “oo” sound at start. If “wine” is hard, make sure you start with a small “oo” shape: oo-ine. It helps prevent the lip bite.
A quick test: Put your fingers on your throat and say “fan” vs “van.” “Fan” (with F) has no vibration (voiceless), “van” (with V) has a clear vibration under your fingers (voiced). Now say “wan.” You’ll still feel vibration (it’s voiced), but check your lip: it shouldn’t be bitten. If you accidentally bit your lip on W, you actually made a V.
Exercises
•	Lip Position Practice: Stand in front of a mirror. Say “ffff” (like you’re forcing air) and note that your top teeth touch your bottom lip. Now say “vvvv” – same position but with voice. This is V. Now relax your mouth and say “oooo” – lips rounded, no teeth touching. Try transitioning “oooo-vvvv-oooo-vvvv”. You should see the difference clearly: teeth on lip for V, and lips just rounding for the “oooo” (similar to W).
•	Minimal Pairs: Practice these V vs W pairs to hear the difference:
•	vest vs west
•	vine vs wine
•	veal vs wheel
•	vow vs wow
•	ivy vs iwa (the second isn’t a word, but just to compare sounds)
When saying the first of each pair (vest, vine, etc.), you should feel your lip under your teeth. For the second (west, wine, etc.), you should not – just rounded lips.
•	Word list: Alternate V and W words:
•	V: van, vet, vine, vote, cave, evil, leave
•	W: wan, wet, wine, woke, wave, weevil, leave (Note: the last leave vs leave may sound same spelling, but imagine one spelled “leeve” (with an actual V sound) vs “lweave” (if it had a W; though leave is actually with a V sound /liːv/). Perhaps use “weave” vs “leave”.)
Listen to yourself or record and play back. Do they sound distinct?
•	Sentences:
•	“We went on a very weird adventure.” – Make sure “very” has a clear V (teeth on lip) and “weird” has the W (no lip bite).
•	“Victor will walk with Wendy.” – “Victor” and “with” have V, “walk” and “Wendy” have W. Exaggerate them while practicing.
•	“I want to visit five wonderful villages.” – Lots of W (want, wonderful) and V (visit, five, villages) alternation.
•	Tongue Twister: “William’s very wary of venomous vipers.” – This alternates W and V: William’s very wary of venomous vipers. Start slowly, ensure each is distinct.
Remember, V = teeth + lip + voice, W = rounded lips, no teeth contact. With time, your mouth will automatically know the difference. Native speakers notice this distinction clearly, so mastering V and W will greatly improve your clarity[30]. Keep practicing, and soon “wine” and “vine” will sound totally different to you!
Chapter 5: “Ship” vs “Sheep” – Short I and Long EE Vowels
Learning Section
English has many vowel sounds, and a common difficulty is distinguishing the short /ɪ/ sound (as in ship or hit) from the long /iː/ sound (as in sheep or heat). These are sometimes called “short i” and “long e” (or just “long i” in some contexts, but here we mean the vowel sound in sheep which is represented as /iː/). Getting this difference right will help avoid misunderstandings like someone hearing “beach” as “bitch” 🙈.
•	/ɪ/ (as in ship, bit, live (verb)): This is a short, relaxed vowel. Your tongue is in a high position but not as high or tense as for /iː/. The lips are neutral (maybe slightly spread, but not as wide as a smile). The sound is quick – don’t draw it out. For example, in “ship”, you cut off the vowel quickly.
•	/iː/ (as in sheep, beat, leave): This is a long, tense vowel. Your tongue is a bit higher and more forward, and your lips often spread into a slight smile shape because the sound is tense and drawn out[32][33]. The vowel lasts longer: sheeeeep. In fact, try exaggerating a smile when practicing /iː/ – “sheep” should make you show some teeth with a grin[32].
Key distinctions:
- Length: /iː/ is held about twice as long as /ɪ/ in speech (especially in stressed syllables).
- Tension: /iː/ feels tenser, /ɪ/ feels more relaxed.
- Mouth shape: /iː/ – lips stretched (like a smile)[32][33]; /ɪ/ – lips more relaxed (slight smile at most).
Examples:
- /ɪ/: fit, hit, rich, live (rhymes with give), list, busy (note: spelling “u” in busy sounds like /ɪ/).
- /iː/: feet, heat, reach, leave, least, easy.
Common minimal pairs (words that differ only by this vowel): - ship vs sheep
- hit vs heat
- live vs leave
- bit vs beat
- rich vs reach
For many non-native speakers, their language might have only one sound in between these two, so they might pronounce both “ship” and “sheep” with the same vowel. In English, that could cause confusion since “ship” (boat) and “sheep” (animal) are very different things! Context usually helps, but it’s worth practicing the difference.
Tips: If you have trouble hearing the difference, try this: - Say “eat” vs “it.” Exaggerate “eat” as “eeeeet” (big smile, long) and “it” as “it” (short, no smile). Notice “eat” almost has an iy sound (some might hear a faint ‘y’ at the end because it’s so tense), whereas “it” is clean and quick. - Use a mirror: When you say a long /iː/ sound like in “green cheese”, you should see your corners of the mouth pulled back (like a grin). For a short /ɪ/ like in “grin”, the mouth is less spread. - Also, check neighboring sounds: English often uses /iː/ at the end of words (spelled -y like happy – that final -y is actually a long ee sound /ˈhæp.iː/) and /ɪ/ in many words before consonants. Paying attention to spelling patterns can sometimes guide you, but be cautious (English spelling is not always consistent).
Exercises
•	Minimal Pair Drilling: Pronounce each pair distinctly:
•	ship – sheep
•	hit – heat
•	live – leave
•	sit – seat
•	chick – cheek
After each pair, pause and ask yourself: did I hold the second word’s vowel longer than the first? Did I smile more on the second? You should answer yes.
•	Listening test: If you have a friend or teacher, have them randomly say one of the pair and you identify which it is. If you’re alone, record yourself saying words randomly from the list, then play back and check if you can tell which you meant to say.
•	Sentence practice:
•	“This fish is cheap” vs “These fees are cheap.” – The first has /ɪ/ in fish, the second has /iː/ in fees. They might sound somewhat similar in a sentence, so be careful.
•	“He’s sitting in the seat.” – Contains both: sitting /ˈsɪtɪŋ/ vs seat /siːt/. Exaggerate the seat to be longer.
•	“Did you live in Leeds?” – live /lɪv/ vs Leeds /liːdz/.
•	“It’s a little bit of peace and quiet.” – bit (short /ɪ/) vs peace (long /iː/). Make them distinct.
•	Tongue position practice: Try a physical trick – for /iː/, imagine your tongue is pushing forward (almost touching your bottom front teeth) to stretch the vowel out, and for /ɪ/, it’s more centered. Some teachers say “smile for sheep, no smile for ship.” Go to the mirror and literally smile big as you say “sheep,” then say “ship” with a relaxed mouth.
•	Additional minimal pairs:
•	fill vs feel
•	bin vs bean
•	rid vs read (past tense “read” is pronounced /red/, but present “read” is /riːd/, so perhaps use rid vs reed to avoid confusion)
•	did vs deed
Make flashcards for these words and test yourself.
English word stress and context often help listeners figure it out even if the vowel length isn’t perfect, but getting this right makes a big difference in clarity. With practice, you’ll hear and produce the difference easily. Remember: sheep says “thank you” (big smile), ship just says it quick with no smile 😄.
Chapter 6: Word Stress in English
Learning Section
Correct word stress (emphasizing the right syllable in a word) is crucial for sounding natural. In English, each multi-syllable word has one stressed syllable (spoken louder, longer, or higher pitch) and the others are weaker. Misplacing stress can make words hard to recognize (for example, pronouncing “deSERT” (to abandon) vs “DESert” (sandy place)). Here are some general guidelines:
•	Two-syllable nouns and adjectives: Usually stress the first syllable[34]. For example:
•	TAble, DOCtor, HAPpy, SUNny.
•	China, mountain (MOUn-tain), present (as a noun: a PREsent = a gift).
About 90% of two-syllable nouns follow this rule[34].
•	Two-syllable verbs: Usually stress the second syllable[35].
•	to reLAX, beGIN, exPORT (verb: to send goods out), decide (de-CIDE).
•	present (as a verb: to preSENT), record (verb: re-CORD, vs noun REcord).
Perhaps ~70% of two-syllable verbs follow this pattern[35], but be cautious – there are exceptions.
•	Noun/Verb pairs: Many words change meaning based on stress:
•	REcord (noun, a thing that records music) vs reCORD (verb, to record audio).
•	IMport (noun, goods brought in) vs imPORT (verb, to bring in goods).
•	CONtract (noun, agreement) vs conTRACT (verb, to shrink or to catch (a disease)).
Generally, noun = first syllable stressed, verb = second[36].
•	Longer words:
•	Prefixes (un-, re-, dis-, etc.) are often not stressed. e.g., un-HAP-py (stress “hap”), re-WRITE (stress “write”).
•	Suffixes: Certain endings never take the stress (they cause stress to shift earlier in the word). For example:
o	Words ending in -tion / -sion: stress the syllable before -tion. e.g. eduCAtion, deciSION (sounds like -ZHUN).
o	-ity: stress the third from last syllable. e.g. eLECtricity (elecTRIC -> electricity).
o	-ogy, -ogy: often third from end. e.g. biOLogy, techNOLogy.
o	-ical: also often third from end. e.g. POlitical, geOlogical.
These are broad rules, and there are exceptions, but they help as starting points.
•	Compound words: If two words form a compound noun (like birthday, football), often the first part is stressed: BIRTHday, FOOTball. For descriptive phrases (adjective + noun), usually the noun gets stress, but in a compound noun the first part does (compare “green house” (a house that is green) vs “GREENhouse” (an object for plants) – as a compound noun, greenhouse stresses “green”).
•	Contextual stress: Sometimes word stress can shift for emphasis or clarity (like stressing a normally unstressed syllable in a name to differentiate, e.g., “I met a Susanne (su-ZANNE), not Susan (SU-zan)”). But that’s more advanced usage.
Why this matters: Incorrect stress can lead to misunderstanding. For example, saying “guiTAR” instead of “GUI-tar” might confuse listeners for a second. Or “phoTOGraph” (correct: PHO-tograph) vs pho-TO-graph (which sounds off).
Tip: Use a dictionary with pronunciation to learn stress (marked by an apostrophe before the stressed syllable, e.g., pho'tograph). Also, listen to native speakers and imitate. Over time, you develop a “feel” for which part sounds natural to stress.
Exercises
•	Identify the stress: For each word below, underline or capitalize the syllable you think is stressed, then check with a dictionary or answer key.
•	manage (MAN-age or man-AGE?)
•	hotel (HO-tel or ho-TEL?)
•	respect (noun: RE-spect, verb: re-SPECT – which is which?)
•	biology (bi-OL-o-gy or BI-ol-o-gy?)
•	information (IN-for-ma-tion or in-FOR-ma-tion?)
(Answers: MANage, hoTEL, REspect (noun) vs reSPECT (verb), biOLogy, inforMAtion.)
•	Noun vs Verb practice: The following words can be both noun and verb. Practice saying the correct form with context:
•	record: REcord (noun: “I love this vinyl REcord”) vs reCORD (verb: “Please reCORD your song”).
•	present: PREsent (noun, gift or adjective meaning current: “a birthday PREsent”, “present situation”) vs preSENT (verb: “She will preSENT the project”).
•	increase: INcrease (noun: “an INcrease in price”) vs inCREASE (verb: “Prices will inCREASE tomorrow”).
Say each in a sentence. You’ll notice the noun naturally gets first syllable stress and the verb the second when used correctly[36].
•	Compound nouns: Read these out loud, stressing the first part:
•	HOTdog (the food) vs hot DOG (a dog that is hot). “I’d love a HOTdog** right now.”
•	BLACKbird (a type of bird) vs black BIRD (any bird that is black). “A BLACKbird** is singing.”
•	GREENhouse (place to grow plants) vs green HOUSE (house painted green). “Plants thrive in a GREENhouse**.”
Hearing the difference in meaning based on stress is a fun quirk of English.
•	Multi-syllable words: Practice these, focusing on the stressed syllable (marked in CAPS here):
•	celeBRÁtion (ce-le-BRA-tion) – stress “BRA” (actually “-BRÁ-”).
•	deMOcracy (de-MO-cra-cy) – stress “MO”.
•	imposSIble (im-pos-SI-ble) – stress “SI”.
•	uniVERsity (u-ni-VER-si-ty) – stress “VER”.
•	reMARKable (re-MARK-able) – stress “MARK”.
Use each in a sentence after saying it alone. E.g., “Graduating from uniVERsity is a big achievement.”
•	Stress shift for emphasis: Say the sentence “I wanted a red car, not a blue car.” Normally “red” and “blue” carry stress as key information. But if you want to correct someone who thought you wanted blue, you’d really stress “red”: “I wanted a RED car, not a blue car.” This shows how we stress words to clarify meaning in context. Practice saying sentences with different stress to see how meaning changes:
•	“I didn’t say she stole the money.” (Try stressing one word at a time: I didn’t say..., I didn’t say..., I didn’t say she stole..., etc. Each version has a slightly different implication.)
Mastering word stress comes with listening and practice. Pay attention to how native speakers break down words. You’ll notice the stressed syllable often “pops” out. With these exercises and awareness, you’ll start stressing words like a native – making your speech more intelligible and flowing.
Chapter 7: Intonation and Sentence Stress
Learning Section
Beyond individual word stress, English uses intonation – the rise and fall of pitch – and sentence stress – emphasizing certain words – to convey meaning and emotion. Getting intonation right helps your speech sound natural and helps listeners understand if you’re asking a question, making a statement, being polite, excited, etc.
1. Sentence Stress (Content vs Function words): In English, typically content words (nouns, main verbs, adjectives, adverbs) are stressed, and function words (articles, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions) are usually unstressed. For example, in the sentence “I need to go to the bank.” – the words need, go, bank carry the stress, while I, to, the are said quickly and weakly. This gives English its rhythm. If you stress every word evenly, it sounds robotic or unnatural.
Example: “THE CAT IS ON THE MAT.” (unnatural if all equal). Natural: “The CAT is on the MAT.” – CAT and MAT are stressed (important info), others are reduced.
Try another: “She will ARRIVE at TEN o’clock.” – we stress arrive and ten, the core info.
2. Intonation Patterns: There are two main patterns: - Falling intonation (⬇️) – Voice pitch falls at the end of the sentence. This is the most common pattern for statements, commands, and WH-questions (questions that begin with who/what/where/etc.)[37][38]. It often indicates completeness or certainty. - “I live in Spain.” (statement – voice falls at end) - “Where are you going?” (WH-question – usually falls at the end) - “Put that down.” (command – falling tone) - “That’s interesting.” (falling tone, neutral statement)
•	Rising intonation (⬆️) – Voice pitch rises at the end. Common for Yes/No questions (questions answerable by yes or no) and for indicating uncertainty or that you’re not finished speaking[39].
•	“Are you coming? (⬆️)” – yes/no question, voice rises[40].
•	“Do you like your new teacher? (⬆️)”[40] – rises, expecting an answer.
•	Also, when we list items, usually we rise on each item except the last. E.g., “I bought apples (⬆️), oranges (⬆️), and bananas (⬇️).” – rising on apples, oranges to signal more to come, then falling on bananas to signal the list is done.
•	Fall-Rise or Rise-Fall: Sometimes intonation is a combination. For example, a polite suggestion or a tentative statement might have a fall then rise (fall-rise) – “Well, I could (⬇️⬆️) go with you, I suppose.” indicating uncertainty or politeness. A rise-fall can indicate strong emotion or emphasis: “Absolutely!” often starts high then falls hard.
Question Tags: - If a tag question is genuinely asking (uncertain), it rises: “You’re coming, aren’t you? (⬆️)”[39][41]. - If it’s just confirming something we expect to be true (not a real question), it falls: “It’s a nice day, isn’t it? (⬇️)” – here you’re just making conversation, not truly asking[42].
Expressive Intonation: Intonation can also show emotion: - Friendly or encouraging: often a bit more rising or sing-song. - Angry or commanding: often a firm falling tone, sometimes with a higher pitch start. - Surprised: a rise on the word expressing surprise: “Really?!” (rising sharply can indicate great surprise or questioning disbelief, whereas “Really.” in falling intonation might sound sarcastic or dismissive).
Politeness: In English, a direct question can be softened by intonation. E.g., “Where’s the report?” (flat falling could sound demanding). But “Where’s the report? (slight rise at end)” can sound more polite or tentative. Also, saying “Could you pass me the salt? (rising a bit at end)” sounds more polite than a flat command tone.
Exercises
•	Intonation identification: Listen to or imagine someone saying these sentences. Mark them ⬆️ or ⬇️:
•	“What time is it?”
•	“Do you need help?”
•	“I’m so happy to see you!”
•	“Really!” (as an exclamation of surprise)
•	“We should go now, shouldn’t we?” (assuming you are pretty sure the answer is yes)
(Answers: 1. ⬇️ (wh-question)[38], 2. ⬆️ (yes/no question)[40], 3. ⬇️ (statement/exclamation, usually falls even if excited it might start high then fall)[43], 4. If genuine surprise, it’s usually ⬆️ (like “Really?!” with a rise). If sarcastic “Really.” then ⬇️, but let’s assume surprise ⬆️. 5. The tag “shouldn’t we?” – if you’re fairly certain and just confirming, it would be ⬇️ (falling)[42].)
•	Practice yes/no vs wh-questions: Say each question in a pair with the right intonation:
•	“Are you coming tonight?” (Yes/No – rising at end) vs “When are you coming tonight?” (Wh-question – falling at end).
•	“Did you finish the project?” (yes/no, rising) vs “What did you finish?” (wh-question, falling).
•	“Is it raining?” (rising) vs “Why is it raining?” (falling).
Hear the difference in your voice. The wh- questions should sound more settled at the end. Yes/no should sound like you’re unsure and inviting an answer.
•	Tag questions: Say the following two ways (once as a real question, once as just confirming):
•	“You’ve been to Paris, haven’t you?”
o	Uncertain (maybe you really don’t know): rise at the end (it will sound like: haven’t you? ⬆️).
o	Confirming (you think they have and you’re just checking in a friendly way): fall at the end (sounds more like a statement: haven’t you. ⬇️).
•	“We can start now, can’t we?” (Try both rising and falling tag intonations, and notice how rising makes it sound like you genuinely ask for permission, falling makes it sound like “we both know we can start”.)
•	Contrastive stress in sentences: In each sentence, stress the bold word strongly to change meaning:
•	“I didn’t say he stole the money.” (Meaning: Someone else said it, not me.)
•	“I didn’t say he stole the money.” (Meaning: I never said it – denying it.)
•	“I didn’t say he stole the money.” (Implying maybe I thought it or implied it, but didn’t say it.)
•	“I didn’t say he stole the money.” (Implying someone else might have stolen it, not him.)
•	“I didn’t say he stole the money.” (Maybe he just borrowed it.)
•	“I didn’t say he stole the money.” (Maybe I said he stole something else.)
This exercise shows how stressing different words (sentence stress) can subtly change the message. Practice these out loud; it’s a great way to become aware of English intonation and emphasis.
•	Emotion through intonation: Say “I can’t believe it” in different ways:
•	Excited happy surprise: Start high pitched and drop a bit – “I can’t believe it!” (enthusiastic, maybe slight rise-fall).
•	Shocked upset surprise: Maybe a rise on “believe” – “I can’t beLIEVE it?!” (voice might crack upward on lieve).
•	Sarcastic/doubtful: Flat or falling, “I can’t believe it.” (monotone or downward, implies actually you can believe it or you’re unimpressed).
Record yourself if possible and see if the emotion comes across just with intonation.
Remember, intonation is like the music of English[44]. Don’t be afraid to exaggerate at first. It’s better to use some intonation even if you overdo it a bit, rather than speak in a monotone. Listen to English speakers (movies, etc.) and mimic the melody of how they speak. With these patterns – falling for statements/WH, rising for yes/no – and an ear for which words to stress in a sentence, you’ll soon express yourself clearly and naturally. People will not only understand your words, but also the feeling behind them.
Chapter 8: Using “Do” and “Does” Correctly
Learning Section
Many English learners get confused about when to use “do” and “does”. These are forms of the verb to do, which can act as a main verb or as an auxiliary (helping) verb in questions and negatives. The rules are straightforward:
•	In Present Simple Tense: Use “does” with third person singular subjects (he, she, it, or singular noun)[45][46]. Use “do” with I, you, we, they and plural subjects[45]. For example:
•	I do the laundry on Sundays.
•	You do a great job.
•	We do our homework every night.
•	They do the dishes after dinner.
•	He does his homework after school[45].
•	She does yoga every morning[45].
•	The dog does a trick for a treat (dog = it).
Remember: third person singular (he, she, it, or anything that can be replaced by those, like “the teacher” = she/he, “John” = he, “that machine” = it) gets does[45]. Others get do.
•	Questions in Present Simple:
•	With I/you/we/they: start with Do. “Do you like coffee?”, “Do they know the answer?”
•	With he/she/it: start with Does. “Does it work?”, “Does she live nearby?”
•	Note: After “do/does” in a question, the main verb goes back to base form (no -s). “Does he like pizza?” (not “likes” because the “does” already took the third-person form).
•	Negatives in Present Simple:
•	I/you/we/they: do not (don’t) + verb. “We don’t have class today.”
•	he/she/it: does not (doesn’t) + verb. “He doesn’t have a car.”
•	Again, no -s on the main verb when using “doesn’t.” (Say “She doesn’t like cold weather,” not “doesn’t likes” – the auxiliary took the s).
•	Short answers:
•	“Do you eat meat?” – “Yes, I do.” / “No, I don’t.”
•	“Does she play piano?” – “Yes, she does.” / “No, she doesn’t.”
•	We use “do/does” alone in short answers to avoid repeating the whole verb phrase.
•	As Main Verbs: “Do” can also be a main verb meaning perform/execute (e.g., do homework, do a favor). In that case also follow the same rule: He does his homework in the evening. (not “he do”). I do my work early. When “do” is the main verb in present simple, it still follows do/does rules.
Common mistakes: - Forgetting the -s: e.g. “He do his homework” (incorrect). It should be “He does his homework.”[45] Many learners forget to add does or -s for third person singular. - Using do and then adding -s to main verb: e.g. “He does eats breakfast”. Incorrect – once you use “does,” the next verb should be base form: “He does eat breakfast” (though normally we’d just say “he eats breakfast” in a statement). So “Does he eat breakfast?” (correct) not “Does he eats breakfast?”.
Think of “does” = “do + s.” It carries the -s for the verb. So you don’t double it. This is why “does he eat” has only one s (in “does”), and “he eats” has the s on “eats” when “does” isn’t there.
Exercises
•	Fill in do/does: Complete the sentences with do, does, don’t, or doesn’t:
•	____ your brother live with you? (Answer: Does your brother live with you?)
•	I ____ like broccoli. (Answer: I don’t like broccoli.)
•	Where ____ you work? (Answer: Where do you work?)
•	She ____ understand the question. (Answer: She doesn’t understand the question.)
•	What ____ they need? (Answer: What do they need?)
•	____ it hurt when you do that? (Answer: Does it hurt...?)
•	He ____ know the answer. (Answer: He doesn’t know the answer.)
•	Why ____ we have to leave? (Answer: Why do we have to leave?)
•	Correct the mistakes: Each sentence has an error with do/does usage. Rewrite them correctly:
•	“She do her exercises every morning.”
•	“Do your friend want to come?”
•	“My parents doesn’t live in the city.”
•	“Does Jack likes pizza?”
•	“I doesn’t have any questions.”
(Possible corrections: 1. She does her exercises every morning. 2. Does your friend want to come? (or “Do your friends want to come?” if plural friend). 3. My parents don’t live in the city. (parents = they) 4. Does Jack like pizza? (remove s from likes) 5. I don’t have any questions.)
•	Short answer practice: Respond to each question with a short answer:
•	“Do you speak English?” – Answer: “Yes, ___.” (Expected: “Yes, I do.”)
•	“Does it snow in your country?” – “No, ___.” (Expected: “No, it doesn’t.” or “No, it does not.”)
•	“Do the students understand the assignment?” – “Yes, ___.” (Expected: “Yes, they do.”)
•	“Does your friend have a car?” – “No, ___.” (Expected: “No, she doesn’t.” assuming friend = she.)
•	Make questions: Form a question for each statement, using do/does:
•	Statement: “You need help.” -> Question: “___ I need help?” (Trick: better: “Do you need help?” to confirm; if turning statement exactly: “Do I need help?” but likely we mean ask the person: “Do you need help?”)
•	Statement: “Tim plays guitar.” -> Question: “___ Tim play guitar?” (Answer: Does Tim play guitar?)
•	Statement: “They live in Canada.” -> Question: “Where ___ they live?” (Answer: Where do they live?)
•	Statement: “This machine works.” -> Question: “___ this machine work?” (Answer: Does this machine work?)
Check that you used “does” for Tim (he) and the machine (it), and “do” for they.
Understanding do/does will also help in other tenses (e.g., past tense uses did for everyone). But in present, always remember that singular third person needs that extra s – either on the verb or in the form of “does.” If you’re unsure, try to conjugate: I do, you do, he/she does, we do, they do. It becomes second nature with practice[45]. So next time you speak, you won’t say “she do” or “he don’t” – you’ll naturally say “she does” and “he doesn’t.”
Chapter 9: Prepositions “At”, “On”, and “In” (Time & Place)
Learning Section
Prepositions at, on, and in are small but mighty words. They often confuse learners because their usage for time and place doesn’t always translate directly from other languages. Let’s break down the general rules for using at, on, in for time and location:
Prepositions of Time:
•	At (a precise time):
•	Use at for clock times: at 3:00 pm, at noon, at midnight[47].
•	Use at for some common expressions: at night (meaning nighttime in general)[48], at the weekend (BrE) or on the weekend (AmE)[49], at Christmas (meaning around Christmas holiday period)[50].
•	Think of at = specific point in time (the exact hour, or a meal time like at breakfast[51]).
•	On (a day or date):
•	Use on for days of the week: on Monday, on Fridays[52].
•	Use on for dates: on July 4th, on 21st June 2025[53].
•	Use on for special days: on New Year’s Day, on my birthday[52].
•	Essentially, on = specific days and dates.
•	In (a longer period):
•	Use in for months: in January, in December[54].
•	Use in for years: in 2020, in 1995[55].
•	Use in for seasons: in (the) summer, in winter[56].
•	Use in for parts of the day: in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening[57] (exception: at night as noted).
•	Use in for longer periods like centuries: in the 21st century[55], or decades: in the 90s.
•	So in = within a general time frame (not pinned to a single day or hour).
Examples: - at 7:30, on Tuesday, in March. - at night, on Christmas Day, in 2010. - at the weekend (UK) / on the weekend (US)[49]. - in the morning, in the past, in the winter.
Prepositions of Place:
•	At (a point, specific location):
•	Use at for specific addresses or points: at 123 Main Street (an exact address)[58].
•	Use at for particular locations when precision is implied: at the door, at the bus stop, at the cinema (meaning at the movie theater location).
•	Use at with certain place nouns: at home, at work, at school, at the office, at the airport[58].
•	Think at = a pin-point (a single point on a map, even if that place is large, we see it as a point: at the supermarket is like at that location on the map).
•	On (on a surface or line):
•	Use on for surfaces: on the table, on the wall, on the floor[59].
•	Use on for streets/roads: on Main Street, on the highway[60].
•	Use on for flat places like on a page, on an island (though island can sometimes use in, context matters).
•	Use on for public transport when we see it as a surface: on the bus, on a plane, on a ship (because you are “on board”).
•	Use on for technology: on the phone, on the Internet, on TV.
•	So on = on top of or along a surface/line.
•	In (inside an area or volume):
•	Use in for enclosed spaces: in the room, in the building, in the car[61].
•	Use in for geographic areas: in a city, in France, in Africa[62][63].
•	Use in for bodies of water or print: in the water (submerged) vs on the water (floating on surface – tricky!). In a newspaper (inside the pages).
•	Use in for inside something physical or metaphorical: in the box, in my hand, in the photo, in a group.
•	In = inside boundaries (an area or volume).
Memory aids: - Time: At a clock time, On a calendar day, In a longer period. (Think: at a POINT, on a SURFACE (calendar), in an ENCLOSURE (month, year)). - Place: At a point (at the station), On a surface (on the table) or line (on the street), In an area/space (in the park, in New York).
Common mistakes: - Saying “on June” (should be in June) or “in Monday” (should be on Monday). - Saying “at morning” (should be in the morning). - Mixing up in/on for location: It’s “in the car” (inside a car), but “on the bus” (we consider you step on a bus like a platform). And “at the bus stop” (point location). - “At downtown” vs “in downtown” – usually “downtown” is an area, so we say “in downtown” or better “downtown” as adverb (“I work downtown.”) or “in the city center.”
Keep in mind some idiomatic uses: - We say “in the photo”, “in the picture” (meaning inside that image). - But “on the map” (because it’s on the surface of the map). - “In the world”, not “on the world” (world is seen as an area). - Some locations just collocate with one or the other (we say “at the beach” when thinking of it as a point event, but “on the beach” if literally on the sand surface – both can work with slight nuance).
Exercises
•	Time preposition quiz: Fill in at, on, or in:
•	I’ll see you ___ Friday. (Answer: on Friday.)
•	The movie starts ___ 7 pm. (Answer: at 7 pm.)
•	His birthday is ___ October. (Answer: in October.)
•	We have a meeting ___ the morning. (Answer: in the morning.)
•	She likes to run ___ night. (Answer: at night.)
•	The conference is ___ March 5th. (Answer: on March 5th.)
•	I graduated ___ 2018. (Answer: in 2018.)
•	Let’s have lunch ___ noon. (Answer: at noon.)
•	Place preposition quiz: Fill in at, on, or in:
•	She lives ___ New York City. (Answer: in New York City.)
•	The cat is ___ the roof of the car! (Answer: on the roof.)
•	I’m waiting ___ the bus stop. (Answer: at the bus stop.)
•	There’s a lot of fish ___ the sea. (Answer: in the sea.)
•	My phone is ___ my pocket. (Answer: in my pocket.)
•	We met ___ the airport. (Answer: at the airport.)
•	He sat ___ the floor, not ___ the chair. (Answer: sat on the floor, not on the chair – or “not in the chair” if it’s like a big armchair you sit in; but likely “on the chair” vs “on the floor”. If we consider a normal chair, we often say “sit on a chair”. We do say “sit in a chair” if it has arms/enclosed. But to keep it simple: on the floor, on the chair.)
•	The notice is ___ the wall ___ the kitchen. (Answer: on the wall in the kitchen.)
•	Fix the preposition: Correct these sentences:
•	“I’ll call you in Tuesday.” (should be on Tuesday.)
•	“He was born at 1990.” (should be in 1990.)
•	“We’ll meet on the library at 5.” (for time “at 5” is right, but place should be at the library: “at the library at 5.” Or “in the library at 5” if you mean inside the building – both could work; generally “at the library” is fine.)
•	“She is in the bus right now.” (we usually say on the bus.)
•	“Put the vase in the table.” (should be on the table.)
•	“Let’s meet in the station entrance.” (Usually: at the station entrance – as a point; if inside: “inside the station at the entrance area” but typically “at the entrance”.)
•	Challenge (explain difference): Why is it:
•	“in the car” but “on the bus”?
•	“on the web page” but “in the book”?
•	“at school” vs “in school” (hint: “at school” = location, “in school” = enrolled/attending as a student, a subtle difference).
(Reflect on these answers: car is small and enclosed so you sit in a car; a bus you can stand/walk inside and it’s more like getting onto a vehicle, idiomatically we say “on a bus/train/plane”. A web page is like a surface you scroll on, a book has content inside pages so you read something in a book. “At school” means at the school location possibly for any reason, “in school” means one is a student or the person is currently attending classes, e.g. “The kids are in school from 8 to 3” means they have classes.)
Memorizing these usage rules and doing lots of examples will help “at/on/in” feel more natural. If unsure, think: time? – is it a specific time (at), a day (on), or a longer period (in)? place? – is it a point (at), on a surface (on), or inside an area (in)? These guidelines cover most situations[64][58]. When in doubt, look it up or listen for what native speakers say. With practice, you’ll get it “in time” (not on time – though on time is a different idiom meaning punctual!). Actually, both “in time” and “on time” are correct but mean different things – English likes its prepositions 😅. Keep practicing them in context.
Chapter 10: Articles: a, an, and the
Learning Section
English articles can be tricky, especially if your native language doesn’t have them. The main articles are “a”, “an” (indefinite articles) and “the” (definite article). There’s also the case of using no article (sometimes called the “zero article”). Here’s how to use them:
•	“a” vs “an” (Indefinite Articles):
•	Use “a” before words that start with a consonant sound. Use “an” before words that start with a vowel sound[65]. The key is the sound, not just the letter.
o	“a dog”, “a car”, “a big university” (note: “university” starts with /j/ sound “yoo”, which is a consonant sound, so “a university”[65]).
o	“an apple”, “an elephant”, “an hour” (note: “hour” starts with /au/ sound because the h is silent, vowel sound, so “an hour”[65]).
o	“an MBA” (said “emm-bee-aye” – starts with /ɛ/ sound).
•	These mean one of something (not specific which one)[66]. Use them only with singular countable nouns (you can’t say “a water” – water isn’t countable; you’d say “some water” or just “water”).
•	General use of a/an (Indefinite):
•	Use a/an when mentioning something for the first time or when it’s not a specific known item[66].
o	“I saw a strange bird yesterday.” (We don’t know which bird, first mention, so a).
o	“She wants to buy an umbrella.” (Any umbrella, not a particular one.)
•	It often means “any one of that group”: a doctor = any doctor, not a particular one.
•	Also used for jobs/professions: She is a teacher. (We always say “an engineer”, “a doctor” when stating someone’s job[67].)
•	“the” (Definite Article):
•	Use “the” when referring to something specific or already known to the listener[68]. This can be because:
o	It’s been mentioned before. “I saw a man and a dog. The dog was barking.” (We introduced “a dog”, now it’s “the dog” because we know which one).
o	There is only one of its kind (unique reference). “The sun is hot.” (There’s only one sun for Earth)[69].
o	The context makes it clear which one. “Could you close the door?” (the door of this room – both speaker and listener know which door).
o	With something specific like “the girl in the red dress” (that particular girl).
•	Use the with superlatives: “the highest mountain”, “the best day” (because superlative implies uniqueness).
•	Use the when describing a specific group: “the students in my class” (not all students, just those in my class – specific subset).
•	Use the with things that are obvious in context: “I’m going to the bathroom.” (in a house, there’s an understood specific bathroom).
•	No Article (Zero Article):
•	Plural or uncountable nouns in general statements usually have no article[70].
o	“Cats are cute.” (means cats in general, not specific cats – no article for general plural)[70].
o	“Water is essential.” (uncountable general statement – no article)[70].
o	Compare: “Children need love.” (all children, general) vs “The children need love.” (specific children we know about).
•	Names of people (John, Dr. Smith), countries (Canada, Japan – but note: countries that are plural or full names with descriptors often take “the”: the United States, the Philippines, the United Kingdom), languages (English not “the English” when referring to the language), meals (breakfast, not “a breakfast” usually, unless qualifying: “a breakfast of eggs”).
•	Institutions when used generally: “at school, in church, to hospital” – often we drop “the” in phrases like “go to school” (meaning attending school), “go to church” (for worship), “go to bed”. If you say “go to the school” you mean the building specifically perhaps not as a student (e.g. a parent visiting).
•	Abstract ideas: “Freedom is important.” (no article).
Summary: - a/an = one (non-specific)[66]. - the = specific one(s)[69]. - no article = general or abstract plural/uncountable[70].
Common mistakes: - Using “the” when talking about things in general. E.g., “The life is short” (incorrect general statement). Say “Life is short.”[70] Another: “The dogs are friendly pets.” If you mean dogs in general, say “Dogs are friendly pets.”[70] - Omitting “the” when it’s needed for specifics. E.g., “I went to market.” Usually, we say “I went to the market.” unless you mean the general concept of doing marketing (but generally, put “the”). - Using a/an with plurals or uncountables. “a information” (no, say “some information” or just “information”). “an advice” (no, “some advice”). - Forgetting “a/an” in singular countable when it’s needed. In English, you can’t usually have a singular countable noun standing alone without an article or determiner. E.g., “I am teacher.” Needs “a”: “I am a teacher.”[67] Or “She bought new phone.” Should be “a new phone.”
Exercises
•	Fill in a/an/the (or leave blank for no article):
•	I saw ___ cat sitting on ___ wall. ___ cat looked hungry. (Answers: a cat, a wall, The cat looked hungry.)
•	She is ___ engineer and her husband is ___ artist. (Answers: an engineer, an artist – both jobs, use indefinite article[67].)
•	___ honesty is ___ best policy. (Answers: ∅ (no article) honesty is the best policy. “Honesty” in general no article, “the best policy” superlative use the.)
•	We went to ___ beach yesterday. ___ beach was crowded. (Answers: We went to the beach yesterday. The beach was crowded. This one is a bit tricky: often locals say “went to the beach” because it’s a specific beach outing. If multiple beaches, first mention could be “a beach”. But usually, people have a specific beach in mind or it’s understood contextually, so “the beach” is common. We’ll accept “We went to the beach. The beach was crowded.”)
•	Do you have ___ questions, or is everything clear? (Answer: any questions – since plural general, any is often used, but with article it would be “Do you have any questions”. If sticking to a/an/the, it’s “any” here. If not using “any”: “Do you have questions” is also possible without any, meaning in general. Let’s say intended answer: no article or “any”.)
•	___ Mount Everest is ___ highest mountain in the world. (Answers: ∅ Mount Everest (no article for proper name of mountain), the highest mountain (superlative, use the).)
•	___ information you gave me was very helpful. (Answer: The information… (specific info that you gave).)
•	I need ___ bottle of water. (Answer: a bottle of water.)
•	___ love is more important than money. (Answer: ∅ Love is more important than money – general concept, no article.)
•	She rented ___ car for the trip. ___ car has GPS. (Answers: a car…, The car has GPS (now specific that she rented).)
•	Correct the errors:
•	“I have the idea.” (If you mean you have an idea (non-specific new idea), say “I have an idea.” If you meant a previously discussed specific idea, then “the” would be okay – context needed. Typically when introducing it, use a.)
•	“Can you pass me salt?” (“the salt” if it’s on the table and both know it’s there).
•	“She is a my friend.” (No double article: just “She is my friend.” or “a friend of mine.”)
•	“Elephants are the large animals.” (General statement about all elephants, should be “Elephants are large animals.” No “the”[70].)
•	“The life is hard sometimes.” (General concept, should be “Life is hard.”[70])
•	“I went to a school to meet a teacher I know.” (If it’s your school or the listener knows which, then “the school” / “the teacher.” If it’s truly some random school and teacher, it might be correct, but likely we mean a specific school and teacher we’ve mentioned or context implies, so “I went to the school to meet the teacher I know.”)
•	“This is the John, he is colleague.” (If introducing John: “This is John, he is a colleague.” No “the” before a name normally, and “a colleague” needs article.)
•	Choose a/an/the or nothing:
•	___ moon goes around ___ earth. (Answer: The moon goes around the earth[69], since both are unique known objects.)
•	She always brings ___ lunch from home. (In general each day: “brings ∅ lunch” is fine, or “a lunch” is not typical; we usually say “brings her lunch” or just “brings lunch”. So answer: no article or “her”. But probably no article: ∅ lunch.)
•	___ Amazon River is longer than ___ Thames. (Rivers: use the: The Amazon, the Thames.)
•	We visited ___ Louvre museum in Paris. (Name of a well-known place: the Louvre.)
•	___ love I feel for my family is endless. (Specific love (the love that I feel): you could say The love I feel… Alternatively, without article “Love I feel for my family is endless” sounds poetic but not usual. So The love.)
Understanding articles takes practice. Always ask: Am I speaking about something general (no article for plural/uncountable, or a/an for singular countable) or something specific (use “the”)? And remember a/an for introducing new singular things[66], and that not every noun needs an article (especially proper nouns and general plurals). With time, you’ll develop an ear for what “sounds right,” and you can always double-check usage in reading materials since articles are very frequent. Don’t be afraid to correct yourself – even advanced learners slip on articles occasionally, but mastering them is a big step toward sounding like a native.
Chapter 11: Make vs Do – Common Collocations
Learning Section
The verbs “make” and “do” both roughly mean to perform or create, but they are used in different expressions. Many languages use one verb for both, but English has specific collocations (common pairings) where we use one or the other. Here’s how to sort them out:
General difference: - DO often implies performing an action, task, or duty – especially repetitive or work-related tasks[71]. It’s also used when speaking in general about actions (like “do something”). - MAKE often means creating, constructing, or producing something new[72], or causing a result or reaction.
However, the best way to know is by learning common combinations:
Common expressions with DO: - do homework / do housework / do chores (duties)[73]. - do work / do a job (perform work tasks)[73]. - do a favor (perform a helpful action). - do exercise / do yoga (more in sense of activity). - do business (engage in business). - do the dishes / do the laundry (household tasks). - do well / do badly (general performance: “He did well on the test”). - do nothing / do something / do anything[73]. - do good / do harm (perform actions that benefit or hurt). - do your best (put forth best effort).
Think of “do” for activities, jobs, and general actions (especially unspecified actions: “What are you doing?” – not making).
Common expressions with MAKE: - make a cake / make food (produce or prepare, though we often say “cook dinner” not “make dinner” – actually “make dinner” is also common; both are used). - make a mistake[74]. - make a decision. - make a noise / make a sound. - make money (earn money)[75]. - make a call (phone call). - make a reservation. - make friends (form friendships). - make a promise[75]. - make a plan. - make an effort. - make a suggestion. - make changes. - make sure (ensure). - make up your mind (decide). - make a joke. - make progress[75]. - make an exception.
Think of “make” for creating or producing something tangible or intangible, or for actions that result in something: make a mess, make trouble, make peace, make an impression.
Overlap / Exceptions: There are some tricky ones: - Do the shopping vs Make a purchase – we usually say “do the shopping” (as a task) but “make a purchase” (formal way to say buy something). - Make homework is wrong; always do homework (because it’s a task). - Make your bed (this means to arrange the bed neatly in the morning). It’s a household task but we say “make the bed,” not “do the bed.” - Do vs Make a mistake – correct is make a mistake (you “create” an error), not “do a mistake.” - We do exercise but we make progress in our exercise. - Make dinner and do dinner: Typically “make dinner” (prepare it). “Do dinner” isn’t common unless slang like “Let’s do dinner” (meaning have dinner together). - Do hair / makeup vs Make hair – we say “do your hair” (style your hair), not make. But “make up” is a verb itself (to invent or to reconcile, or noun “makeup”). We say “do makeup” or “put on makeup.”
A handy rule some suggest: - If it’s related to work, duties, or unspecified actions, use do (do homework, do a task). - If it’s related to creating or producing, use make (make a sandwich, make a speech).
But many are just fixed expressions that must be memorized.
Exercises
•	Fill in do or make:
•	Please ___ the dishes after dinner. (Answer: do the dishes.)
•	I need to ___ a phone call. (Answer: make a phone call.)
•	He ___ a huge mistake on the report. (Answer: made a huge mistake.)
•	She ___ her homework before watching TV. (Answer: does her homework.)
•	Let’s ___ a plan for the weekend. (Answer: make a plan.)
•	Can you ___ me a favor? (Answer: do me a favor.)
•	They ___ a lot of money from that deal. (Answer: made a lot of money.)
•	I try to ___ at least 30 minutes of exercise every day. (Answer: do exercise.)
•	We should ___ an effort to arrive on time. (Answer: make an effort.)
•	Don’t ___ noise, the baby is sleeping. (Answer: Don’t make noise.)
•	Correct or natural? Decide if the usage is right or wrong, if wrong, correct it:
•	“I need to do a decision.” (Incorrect – should be make a decision.)
•	“She made her homework already.” (Incorrect – should be did her homework.)
•	“Let’s make a party for him.” (We usually say “have a party” or “throw a party,” not “do a party.” If forced between do/make, “make a party” is not idiomatic. Throw a party is best.)
•	“He is making progress with his English.” (Correct ✅.)
•	“Could you do the bed?” (Incorrect phrasing – make the bed is correct for tidying up bedding.)
•	“Try not to make any mistakes.” (Correct ✅.)
•	“I’ll do the cake for the birthday.” (Better: make the cake, since you bake it.)
•	“We made business together in 2019.” (We’d say “did business together”.)
•	“This research will do a difference.” (No, use make a difference.)
•	“She can’t come, she has to do some work.” (Correct ✅.)
•	Collocation match: Match the start of an expression to the correct “do” or “make” phrase:
•	do: [ ] a favor, [ ] the laundry, [ ] nothing, [ ] a report, [ ] yoga.
•	make: [ ] a appointment (trick: it’s “make an appointment”), [ ] a mistake, [ ] an excuse, [ ] dinner, [ ] noise.
(All the do items take “do”: do a favor, do the laundry, do nothing, do a report (or write a report, but do a report can be used), do yoga. Make items: make an appointment, make a mistake, make an excuse, make dinner, make noise.)
•	Your own examples: Write two sentences: one with “do” and one with “make” correctly used. For example:
•	“Every morning I do a 10-minute workout.”
•	“I need to make an appointment with the dentist.”
Reviewing these collocations can help. It might be useful to memorize them in groups or use flashcards. Over time, it will sound right – you’ll remember that we “make a choice” but “do our duty,” etc. Whenever you learn a new phrase in English, note whether it uses do or make. A tip: if you can count it or create it, often it’s make (make a cake, make a list, make a mess), if it’s an activity or task, often do (do homework, do a job, do research – note: we typically say “do research” not “make research”). Keep practicing, and soon you won’t have to think about which to use – it’ll come naturally[71][76].
Chapter 12: Say vs Tell (and Speak vs Talk)
Learning Section
English has several verbs related to communication, and they’re not interchangeable. The most commonly confused are “say” and “tell,” and also “speak” and “talk.” Let’s clarify each:
“Say” vs “Tell”:
•	Say is used for what someone spoke (the words). It’s often used without the person being addressed, or followed by a clause (what was said)[77][78].
•	Generally: say + something (words) (to someone).
•	“She said (that) she was tired.”[77] (focus on the words she spoke).
•	If you include who is spoken to, use “to”: She said to me that she was tired. (But we prefer “told me” in that case usually.)
•	Use “say” in direct quotes: He said, “I’ll be late.”.
•	Common phrases: say hello, say something, say a word, say sorry.
•	Tell is used for informing someone – it usually requires a personal object (tell someone something)[77][78].
•	Generally: tell + someone + something.
•	“She told me that she was tired.”[79] (we know who she informed – me).
•	“Tell” is not used with exact quotes as often (we wouldn’t usually do: She told, “I am tired.” Instead: She told me, “I am tired” – but even that sounds a bit off; better: She said, “I am tired.”).
•	Use “tell” if mentioning the listener: tell you a story, tell him the truth, tell her a secret[80].
•	We do not use “tell” without an object (incorrect: “She told that she was tired.” – you must say told me/us/someone or change to “said”)[81].
•	A trick: If you can insert a person right after, it’s likely “tell”: ( me something?), if not, use say. E.g., “ me what happened” (tell me), vs “___ what happened” (say what happened). Tell almost always needs a person receiving the info[81][82].
•	Say vs Tell summary: say = utter words, focus on content of speech; tell = inform or instruct someone, focus on delivering message to someone.[77][78]
“Speak” vs “Talk”:
•	Both mean to communicate verbally, but “speak” is often more formal or one-directional, and “talk” is more informal or conversational[83][84].
•	Use speak:
•	For languages: I speak English. (not “talk English”)[85].
•	Formal contexts or one-way communication: The manager will speak at the meeting.[86] (like give a speech).
•	Phone: “Hello, may I speak to John?” (slightly formal/polite).
•	Phrases: speak up (talk louder), speak on a topic[87].
•	“Speak to/with someone” is slightly more formal than “talk to/with”[88] (but both are used).
•	Speak is also used when the emphasis is on the act of verbalizing: She can’t speak at the moment (maybe lost voice).
•	Use talk:
•	For informal conversation: We talked for hours.[83].
•	Dialogue or chat: Talk to your friend about it. (less formal than speak).
•	Phrases: talk about something (discuss)[89], talk to/with someone (converse)[90].
•	Idioms: talk business (discuss business)[91], small talk (casual chat)[92].
•	Generally, talk implies a two-way exchange or a more casual approach[83][84].
•	Speak vs Talk nuance:
•	“Speak” can sound a bit more serious or formal. “I need to speak with you.” might sound a bit urgent or formal. “Can we talk?” sounds more casual or personal[93][94].
•	If you say someone “talks a lot,” or “loves to talk,” it’s normal. “Loves to speak” isn’t as common unless referring to public speaking.
•	Use “speak” for formal speeches: speak in front of an audience, speaker (the person giving a speech).
•	“Talk” is often for conversation: talk on the phone, talk about your day.
Summary of speak vs talk: Speak = formal or ability (speak a language) or one-way, Talk = informal or two-way conversation[84]. In many cases they overlap (e.g., “We need to talk” vs “We need to speak” – first is more common).
Exercises
•	Fill in say/tell:
•	Please ___ me the truth. (Answer: tell me the truth[95].)
•	What did she ___ to you? (Answer: What did she say to you?)
•	He ___ he would be late. (Answer: He said he would be late[96].)
•	Don’t ___ a word about this to anyone. (Answer: Don’t say a word… – fixed phrase “say a word” (meaning don’t speak at all). Could also be “don’t tell anyone,” but given structure: “don’t say a word.”)
•	I can’t ___ you how happy I am. (Answer: I can’t tell you how happy I am. Common expression.)
•	Did you ___ your boss about the issue? (Answer: Did you tell your boss… (because mentioning the person)[78].)
•	She ___ to him, “I’ll call you.” (Answer: She said to him, “I’ll call you.” Or simply: She said, "I'll call you." Often we prefer: She said, "I'll call you." If including him, use said to him.)
•	I told her not to worry, but she didn’t listen (Is this correct? Yes, told her is correct since person specified.)
•	Fill in speak/talk:
•	Do you ___ English? (Answer: speak English[85].)
•	We need to ___ about yesterday. (Answer: need to talk about yesterday – implies discussion.)
•	He will ___ at the conference tomorrow. (Answer: He will speak at the conference[86].)
•	I love to ___ with my grandma on the phone. (Answer: love to talk with my grandma.)
•	She doesn’t ___ much during meetings. (Answer: doesn’t talk much during meetings – could also use speak, but “talk much” implies participate in discussion; “speak much” is less common.)
•	I’ll ___ to the teacher about my grade. (Answer: I’ll talk to the teacher – more common than speak in this casual context. “speak to the teacher” is okay but a bit more formal. Likely answer expects “talk to”.)
•	He can ___ three languages. (Answer: can speak three languages[85].)
•	They were ___ing so loudly I couldn’t concentrate. (Answer: They were talking so loudly… – because it’s conversational noise.)
•	Choose the right verb:
•	She (said/told) me that she’d be abroad next week. (Answer: She told me... because we have me[77].)
•	What did you (say/tell)? I didn’t hear. (Answer: What did you say? – general “what words did you speak?”)
•	My dad always (says/tells) that life is not fair. (Trick: It should be says – “My dad always says, ‘life isn’t fair.’” If phrased as what he often expresses. If we use tell, we need “tells me/us”. Without an object, use says.)
•	Can I (speak/talk) to the manager, please? (Answer: “speak to the manager” – formal/polite request[88].)
•	We (talked/spoke) about our plans over dinner. (Either could work, but talked is more casual and likely expected.)
•	The president (spoke/talked) for nearly an hour in the press conference. (Answer: The president spoke for nearly an hour – formal speech context.)
•	My son is just beginning to (talk/speak) – he can say a few words now. (Either could work. “Beginning to talk” is common for child’s first words. “speak” is also fine. I’d lean talk.)
•	I (said/told) goodbye and left. (Answer: I said goodbye – we say "say hello/goodbye" not tell.)
•	Fix the mistake:
•	“He said me that he’d arrive at 8.” (Should be told me that…[96].)
•	“Can you tell to me where the station is?” (Remove “to”: Can you tell me where… or say where the station is? Typically: Could you tell me…)
•	“She always tells that she’s busy.” (She always says that she’s busy. / She always tells me she’s busy – need object if use tells.)
•	“Let’s speak about what happened.” (More natural: Let’s talk about what happened – informal discussion.)
•	“I need to talk English more often.” (I need to speak English more often – for language, use speak.)
•	“We spoke on the phone for hours about nothing.” (This is actually okay, but “talked on the phone for hours” is more usual. It’s informal context, so “talked” fits better. So maybe expected answer: We talked on the phone for hours.)
•	“Don’t talk with your mouth full.” (This is correct usage actually. Possibly they expect “don’t speak with your mouth full.” Actually, both “don’t talk with your mouth full” and “don’t speak with your mouth full” are used. “Talk” might be more common and admonishing a child, it’s fine. So either is okay. If they intended error: maybe they think proper idiom is “don’t talk with your mouth full” – that is correct. No correction needed.)
Understanding these communication verbs will make your speech clearer. Remember: you tell someone something[78], you say something (or say something to someone). You speak languages or in formal settings, and you talk in informal chats[84]. With practice, choosing these words correctly will become second nature.
Chapter 13: Present Perfect vs Past Simple
Learning Section
English has two common past tenses that often confuse learners: Present Perfect (have/has + past participle, e.g. I have done) and Past Simple (did, e.g. I did). They are used differently, especially regarding time references.
Past Simple (e.g., I went, She **saw): - Use for completed actions in a finished time period[97]. Key: the event is over and we often mention when it happened (or it’s understood). - If there is a specific time stated or implied (yesterday, last year, in 2010, 5 minutes ago, etc.), use Past Simple[98]. - “I went to Paris in 2019.” (specific year in past – finished time[98].) - “She ate breakfast at 7 am.” (time given, done.) - “We saw that movie last week.” - Use for a sequence of past events or narrative: “He opened the door, walked in, and found the letter.” - Use for a past habit (often with adverbs like “often, always” or phrases like “used to”): “I played soccer when I was a kid.”
Present Perfect (e.g., I have gone, She has seen): - Use for actions that have a connection to the present or unspecified time until now[97]. Common uses: - Life experience (unspecified time): “I have visited Japan.” (at some point in life, not saying when[97]. Implies up to now, that has happened.) - Unfinished time period (e.g., this week, today if day not finished): “I have had two cups of coffee today.” (today is still ongoing). - Recently completed actions (with just): “I have just finished my work.” - Actions with impact on present: “I’ve lost my keys.” (meaning I don’t have them now)[99]. - Repeated actions up to now: “He has visited her many times.” (over a period up to present). - Duration from past to present (with for/since): “We have known each other for 5 years.” (from 5 years ago until now, still know each other).
•	Signals for present perfect: ever, never, already, yet, just, so far, up to now, recently, etc., or for/since with durations continuing to present.
•	“Have you ever been to London?” (ever = at any time in your life up to now).
•	“I’ve never tried sushi.”
•	“He’s already finished his homework.”
•	“We haven’t met yet.”
Key distinction: - Present Perfect = unspecified when, or time period still ongoing, or relevance now[97][99]. - Past Simple = specified when (even if just understood), or finished time period.
For example: - “I have seen that movie.” (Present Perfect – at some point before now, not saying when)[97]. Often implied maybe “... have you? I have seen it too.” The experience exists in your life record. - “I saw that movie last night.” (Past Simple – definite time given, last night)[98].
Another: - “She has moved to Canada.” (Focus on result: she is in Canada now; maybe recently moved.) - “She moved to Canada in 2015.” (Specific past date/event, finished.)
Common learner errors: - Using Present Perfect with specific past time expressions: ❌ “I have seen him yesterday.” (Yesterday is finished -> should be Past Simple: “I saw him yesterday.”)[98]. - Using Past Simple for life experiences without time: ❌ “Did you ever go to Paris?” (Better: “Have you ever been to Paris?”) - In American English, there’s a bit more flexibility in informal speech; Americans might say “Did you eat yet?” instead of “Have you eaten yet?” But on exams and formal English, stick to the rules above.
Quick formula: - If the question “When (exactly)?” is answered or could be, use Past Simple. - If the time is “until now” or unspecified, and we care about now, use Present Perfect.
Exercises
•	Choose Past Simple or Present Perfect:
•	I (have visited / visited) France three times. (Likely have visited three times (experience up to now) – no specific time given.)
•	He (has finished / finished) his work an hour ago. (Hour ago = specific past time -> finished.)
•	We (didn’t see / haven’t seen) that movie yet. (Use haven’t seen yet – “yet” with negative typically present perfect.)
•	I (have known / knew) her since 2010. (have known since 2010 – still know her now.)
•	They (moved / have moved) to this city in 2018. (2018 is a finished year -> moved.)
•	(Did you ever eat / Have you ever eaten) sushi? (Have you ever eaten sushi – asking about experience with “ever”.)
•	I (have lost / lost) my keys. I can’t find them. (No time given, result now -> have lost my keys.)
•	She (has just left / just left) – you might catch her outside. (has just left – just with recent action.)
•	We (didn’t decide / haven’t decided) what to do yet. (haven’t decided yet – still pending.)
•	Last year we (have gone / went) to Spain. (went – last year is finished.)
•	Fill in the blank with since or for (present perfect often):
•	I’ve lived here ___ five years. (Answer: for five years.)
•	She’s been studying English ___ 2019. (Answer: since 2019.)
•	We haven’t seen each other ___ months. (Answer: for months (if unspecified how many, you could say “for months” meaning a few months). Or if a number “for 3 months”.)
•	He’s known her ___ childhood. (Answer: since childhood (starting point).)
•	It hasn’t rained ___ last week. (Answer: since last week.)
•	Correct the sentences:
•	“I have seen him yesterday.” (Wrong time reference. Should be “I saw him yesterday.”[98])
•	“Did you ever go to Japan?” (For experience, better “Have you ever been to Japan?”)
•	“We haven’t talked about it last night.” (Last night is finished -> “We didn’t talk about it last night.”)
•	“I’ve finished my homework two hours ago.” (“I finished my homework two hours ago.” Two hours ago = past simple.)
•	“She didn’t call me yet.” (Use present perfect with “yet” in BrE formal: “She hasn’t called me yet.” In casual AmE, people say “didn’t call yet,” but let’s use present perfect.)
•	“I am here since 2015.” (To express duration: “I have been here since 2015.” Present perfect.)
•	“It’s the first time I am here.” (Should be present perfect: “It’s the first time I’ve been here.” Often we use present perfect after “it’s the first/second time…” when referring to experiences.)
•	“We’ve been to the library this morning.” (If morning is still current time frame, OK; if said later in the day when morning is over, you should use past: “We went to the library this morning.” Let’s assume morning is over -> “We went to the library this morning.”)
Understanding the difference between these tenses takes practice. Think about whether you’re describing when it happened (use Past Simple) or that it happened (at some point up to now) (use Present Perfect)[97][98]. Pay attention when reading or listening to English – you’ll start noticing why a certain tense is used. Over time, you’ll internalize these time distinctions. Remember: Present Perfect is “perfectly connected” to the present; Past Simple is simply over and done. [97][98]
Chapter 14: Countable vs Uncountable (Much, Many, Few, Little, Some, Any)
Learning Section
Nouns in English can be countable (you can count them: one apple, two apples) or uncountable (mass nouns you don’t usually count individually: water, information). This affects which words you use with them, like much/many and few/little.
•	Many vs Much:
•	Use many with plural countable nouns[100]:
o	many books, many people, many ideas.
o	Often in questions and negatives: “Do you have many friends here?” “I don’t have many options.”
o	In affirmative, we often use “a lot of” instead of many for a natural tone, but many is fine too: “I have many friends” (formal-ish) vs “I have a lot of friends” (more casual).
•	Use much with uncountable nouns[100]:
o	much water, much time, much money.
o	Usually in questions/negatives: “How much time do we have?” “I don’t have much money.” In affirmative, “a lot of” is more common than much: we say “I have a lot of money” (not usually “I have much money” in everyday speech).
•	Rule of thumb: if you can count it in numbers, use many; if it’s a mass or abstract quantity, use much[101].
•	Few vs Little (and “a few” vs “a little”):
•	Few (without “a”) means almost none (negative sense) with countables[102]:
o	“Few people attended the meeting.” (Means not many attended, almost none – implies it was disappointingly low).
•	A few means some, a small number (positive sense) with countables[102]:
o	“A few people attended the meeting.” (Means some did; better than none).
o	“I have a few friends coming over.” (some friends, enough).
•	Little (without “a”) means almost none with uncountables[102]:
o	“There is little water left.” (nearly none, not enough).
•	A little means some (but maybe not a lot) with uncountables[102]:
o	“There is a little water left.” (some remains, which is better than nothing).
•	So notice the “a” changes the meaning to a more positive “some”[102][103].
o	Compare: “Few students understood” (hardly any understood) vs “A few students understood” (some did, which is a relief maybe)[103].
o	“I have little hope” (almost no hope) vs “I have a little hope” (I have some hope).
•	Some vs Any:
•	Use some typically in positive statements or when offering/requesting:
o	“I have some questions.” (a certain number, not zero).
o	“We need some sugar.” (uncountable, an unspecified amount).
o	In offers/requests: “Would you like some coffee?” (We expect the answer likely yes)[104].
o	“Can I have some help?”[105].
•	Use any in questions and negatives[106]:
o	“Do you have any questions?”
o	“I don’t have any money.”
o	Exception: in a question where you're expecting a yes or encouraging, you can use some (“Did you bring some snacks?” if you think yes). But generally, any for unknown.
o	Also “any” in a positive sentence can mean “it doesn’t matter which”: “Take any seat you like.”
•	No: sometimes “no” + noun is used to emphatically say none: “I have no money” (same as I don’t have any money).
•	A lot (of), lots (of):
•	Work with both countable and uncountable in affirmative sentences[107]:
o	a lot of people (countable plural), a lot of water (uncountable)[108].
o	They basically mean “many/much” in a friendlier way for positives.
o	In negatives and questions, we tend to revert to much/many.
•	Compound expressions:
•	How much/many: “How many people?”, “How much coffee?”[109].
•	Too much/too many: “too much work”, “too many mistakes”[110].
•	Enough goes with both: “enough time” (uncountable), “enough chairs” (countable).
Quick table:
	Countable (plural)	Uncountable (singular form)
large quantity (affirmative)	a lot of / lots of (also "many" formal)	a lot of / lots of (also "much" formal)
large quantity (negatives ?)	many (not many)	much (not much)
small quantity (positive)	a few (some)[102]
a little (some)[102]

tiny/insufficient quantity	few (almost none)[102]
little (almost none)[111]

questions	many (How many...?)[109]
much (How much...?)[112]

general some	some (in positives, or polite offers)[106]
some (in positives/offers)
general any	any (negatives/questions)[106]
any (negatives/questions)
Examples: - We have many friends in town, but we don’t have many in the next city. - I have a few errands to run (so I’m not completely free, but not a lot). I have few complaints about the service (meaning I’m basically satisfied). - There is little time left (hurry up!). With a little more time, we can finish (we have some extra time, that helps). - Do you need some help? (offer) — No, thanks. I don’t need any help right now. - She gave me a lot of advice. (advice is uncountable, so not “many advices”). - How much coffee do you drink? How many cups of coffee? (cups are countable).
Exercises
•	Choose the right quantifier:
•	I don’t have (many / much) time today. (Time is uncountable -> much time.)
•	There aren’t (many / much) restaurants in this area. (Restaurants countable plural -> many restaurants.)
•	He has (a few / a little) good friends in the city. (Friends countable plural -> a few good friends (meaning some). “a little good friends” is wrong.)
•	We need (a few / a little) more sugar for this recipe. (Sugar uncountable -> a little more sugar.)
•	She has very (few / little) patience for TV shows. (Patience uncountable -> very little patience (almost none).)
•	Only (a few / a little) students understood the lesson. (Students countable -> a few students (some did, implying some didn’t). If we said “few students understood”, that would mean almost none understood.)
•	Do you have (some / any) siblings? (Question – generally any siblings.)
•	I didn’t get (some / any) sleep last night. (Negative -> any sleep.)
•	We saw (a lot of / many) stars in the sky last night. (Both are possible, but in a casual statement a lot of stars is common.)
•	He put too (many / much) salt in the soup. (Salt uncountable -> too much salt[110].)
•	Fill in some/any:
•	There is ___ milk in the fridge, but there isn’t ___ juice. (Answer: There is some milk, but there isn’t any juice.)
•	I don’t need ___ help, thanks. (Answer: I don’t need any help.)
•	She has ___ interesting ideas. (Answer: She has some interesting ideas.)
•	Are there ___ questions? (Answer: Are there any questions?[106])
•	I have ___ bad news. (Answer: I have some bad news. We use some in affirmatives, even with “news” which is uncountable and often in a slightly negative context, we still say some bad news.)
•	Correct the errors:
•	“He doesn’t have much friends.” (Friends countable -> many friends in negative.)
•	“We need many sugar for this recipe.” (We need a lot of sugar or much sugar in a formal recipe context, but usually “a lot of sugar.”)
•	“How many money does it cost?” (Money uncountable -> How much money does it cost[101]?)
•	“She only has a little books in her room.” (Books countable -> a few books. Or “only has few books” depending on nuance, but likely “a few books”.)
•	“There’s not many time left.” (Time uncountable -> not much time left.)
•	“I have few homework tonight.” (Homework uncountable -> little homework or better “I don’t have much homework.” If we mean it positively “only a little homework”. Without article “few homework” is wrong.)
•	“Can I have any water, please?” (Request -> should use some water please[105].)
•	“A little students failed the exam.” (Students countable -> likely meant “A few students failed” if some did. Or if emphasizing not many failed: “Few students failed the exam” (most passed). So correct depending on intent: A few students failed.)
•	“I’ve got a lot books to read.” (Needs a lot of books.)
•	“She didn’t make no mistakes.” (Double negative. Should be She didn’t make any mistakes. Or She made no mistakes. But not both.)
Understanding countable vs uncountable will help with using these quantifiers correctly[100][113]. If a noun is something you can count individually (apples, cars), use many/few and plural forms. If it’s a substance or concept (water, rice, information, advice), treat it as singular and use much/little. And remember the “a few/a little” vs “few/little” difference[114] – it can change your meaning a lot. With practice, these will become natural and you won’t have to “think” about whether to use much or many; it will just sound right.
Chapter 15: Everyday Idioms and Expressions
Learning Section
Idioms and common phrases make your English sound more natural. They are figurative expressions whose meaning isn’t obvious from the individual words. Here are 10 common idioms that native speakers use, along with their meanings and examples:
1.	Break the ice – To initiate conversation or ease tension when meeting people[115].
Example: “At the meeting, he told a joke to break the ice.” (He eased the atmosphere so people felt more comfortable)[115].
2.	Cut corners – To do something the easiest or cheapest way, often neglecting quality[116].
Example: “The company cut corners on safety and now they have problems.” (They didn’t do everything properly to save money)[117].
3.	Hit the nail on the head – To be exactly right about something[118].
Example: “You hit the nail on the head with that answer.” (You said exactly the right thing)[118].
4.	Piece of cake – Very easy task[119].
Example: “The test was a piece of cake; I finished in 10 minutes.” (The test was extremely easy)[119].
5.	Cost an arm and a leg – Be very expensive[120].
Example: “My new phone cost an arm and a leg.” (It was very pricey)[120].
6.	Bite off more than you can chew – Take on more than you can handle[121].
Example: “By volunteering for three projects, I think I bit off more than I can chew.” (I took too much work)[121].
7.	Beat around the bush – Avoid saying something directly[122].
Example: “Stop beating around the bush and tell me what happened.” (Stop avoiding the main point)[123].
8.	Cry over spilt milk – Complain about a loss from the past that you can’t change[124].
Example: “Yes, we lost the game, but there’s no use crying over spilt milk.” (Don’t worry about what can’t be undone)[124].
9.	Under the weather – Feeling slightly ill[125].
Example: “I’m feeling under the weather today, so I’ll stay home.” (I feel a bit sick)[125].
10.	Speak of the devil – Said when someone appears just after being mentioned (like they show up and you say, "speak of the devil!")[126].
Example: “Hey, speak of the devil – we were just talking about you!” (You showed up right when we mentioned you).
These idioms are used in casual conversation. Using them appropriately can greatly enhance your fluency – but be careful to learn their proper context. They are often metaphorical: - For instance, “cost an arm and a leg” is not literal – no limbs lost! It just emphasizes high cost. - “Under the weather” has nothing to do with weather, it’s just about health.
Notes on usage: - Many idioms are set phrases with little variation. For example, we say “hit the nail on the head” (not “hit the nail on its head”). - Some idioms have a story or cultural origin, but you don’t need to know that to use them. - They tend to be more common in spoken English and informal writing. In formal writing, you might avoid idioms.
Exercises
•	Match the idiom to its meaning:
•	“to cut corners”
•	“piece of cake”
•	“under the weather”
•	“beat around the bush”
•	“cost an arm and a leg”
a. very easy task.
b. avoid directly addressing the topic.
c. do something cheaply or carelessly to save time/money.
d. be slightly sick.
e. be very expensive.
(Answers: 1-c [116], 2-a [119], 3-d [125], 4-b [122], 5-e [120].)
•	Fill in the blank with an idiom (use correct form):
•	It was hard to convince everyone at first, but a fun activity helped ___. (Break the ice[115].)
•	I know you’re upset about the error, but there’s no use ____ now. (crying over spilt milk[124].)
•	My uncle is very frugal; he always tries to ___ when he repairs his house. (cut corners[116].)
•	You look a bit pale. Are you ____? (under the weather[125]?)
•	A 5-minute mile? For him, that’s a ____; he’s a pro runner. (piece of cake[119].)
•	Which idiom would you use in these situations:
•	Your friend keeps avoiding the main point of a story. (He's beating around the bush. Tell him to get to the point[122].)
•	You just mentioned a colleague and then they walk into the room. (You’d say, "Speak of the devil!" as a light joke[126].)
•	You tried to do too many things at once and now you’re overwhelmed. (Admit you bit off more than you can chew[121].)
•	Someone solved a problem exactly correctly. (You tell them they hit the nail on the head[118].)
•	You promise to be on time but arrive 30 minutes late. (You might say, "Sorry, I know I’m late – I have no excuse," or maybe realize you made a mistake. This situation might not match one of the given idioms well. Perhaps skip or accept "no excuse" is not from our idioms list. Or use a relevant one like "I won’t beat around the bush – I messed up.")
•	True or False:
•	"Cost an arm and a leg" can describe a person in pain. (False – it’s about high price[120].)
•	"Under the weather" means very energetic. (False – it means feeling ill[125].)
•	"Piece of cake" refers to a delicious dessert specifically. (False – it means something very easy[119].)
•	"Break the ice" might involve actual ice in literal meaning. (False – it’s metaphorical for easing social tension[115].)
•	"Hit the nail on the head" implies someone is very clumsy with a hammer. (False – it means they got something exactly right[118].)
Try to incorporate idioms when speaking: e.g., instead of saying "It's very easy," say "It's a piece of cake." But use them in the right context – that comes with listening practice. Too many idioms can sound unnatural, so sprinkle them appropriately. Over time, you’ll start understanding common ones from TV, movies, and chats, and you’ll feel comfortable using them to sound more like a native speaker.
Chapter 16: Phrasal Verbs for Natural Speech
Learning Section
Phrasal verbs are verbs combined with one or two particles (prepositions/adverbs) that create a new meaning (e.g., “find out,” “pick up,” “get along”). They are extremely common in everyday English and often replace more formal verbs. Here are 10 essential phrasal verbs and how to use them:
1.	get up – to rise from bed or from a seated position.
Example: “I get up at 7 AM every day.” (wake and leave bed)
“Please don’t get up, I can find the exit myself.” (don’t stand on my account)
2.	find out – to discover or learn information[127].
Example: “I need to find out who called me earlier.” (learn/discover who it was)
“He found out that the meeting was canceled.” (he discovered the fact)
3.	pick up – multiple meanings: to lift, to collect someone, to learn casually, etc.
4.	Lift: “Could you pick up that pen for me?”
5.	Collect (by car): “I’ll pick you up at the airport at 8.”
6.	Learn: “She picked up some Spanish while traveling in Mexico.” (acquired informally)
7.	hang out – to spend time relaxing (informal).
Example: “We usually hang out at the mall after school.” (spend time not doing much)
“Do you want to hang out this weekend?” (spend leisure time together)
8.	run out (of) – to use up a supply (and have none left).
Example: “We ran out of gas on the highway.” (our gas was completely used up)
“Time is running out – please submit your answers now.” (time is almost finished)
9.	give up – to stop trying, to surrender.
Example: “Don’t give up – you can solve this problem!” (don’t quit)
“After two failures, he almost gave up on the project.” (quit the project)
10.	figure out – to solve or understand something after thinking.
Example: “I can’t figure out this math problem.” (can’t find the solution)
“She finally figured out how to open the file.” (understood the method)
11.	call off – to cancel (an event, arrangement)[128].
Example: “They called off the meeting due to bad weather.” (canceled it)
“The search was called off after it got dark.”
12.	look forward to – to anticipate (something pleasant) happily. (Note: to here is a preposition, so if a verb follows, use -ing: “look forward to meeting you.”)
Example: “I’m looking forward to the concert next week.” (excited about it)
“She looks forward to seeing her family at Christmas.”
13.	turn on / turn off – to start or stop a device/power flow.
Example: “Please turn off the lights when you leave.”
“He turned on the TV to watch the news.”
These are just a few; there are hundreds of phrasal verbs, but these appear often in daily life. Notice: - Some are inseparable (you cannot put an object in the middle): e.g., “run out of X” – you can’t say “run X out of” – it stays together[129]. - Some are separable: you can place the object between verb and particle, especially if the object is a pronoun[130]. e.g., “turn off the light” = “turn the light off” = “turn it off”[131]. - If the object is a pronoun (him, it, them), and the phrasal verb is separable, you must separate: “turn it off”, not “turn off it”[132]. - Some have multiple meanings depending on context (like pick up, turn up, get on, etc.).
Using phrasal verbs makes your speech more colloquial: - Instead of “discover,” you often hear “find out.” - Instead of “cancel,” “call off.” - Instead of “quit/stop,” “give up.” - Instead of “exit (a vehicle),” “get off the bus,” etc.
Exercises
•	Match phrasal verb to definition:
•	find out
•	give up
•	hang out
•	pick up (in context of giving someone a ride)
•	call off
a. cancel an event[128].
b. discover information[127].
c. collect someone by car.
d. stop trying or surrender.
e. spend time relaxing.
(Answers: 1-b, 2-d, 3-e, 4-c, 5-a.)
•	Fill in the blanks:
•	We’ve __ milk; can you buy some? (Answer: run out of milk.)
•	She __ early every day to go jogging. (Answer: gets up early.)
•	I can’t __ how this gadget works. (Answer: figure out how it works.)
•	Let’s __ at the park this afternoon. (Answer: hang out at the park.)
•	He had to __ the barbecue because of the rain. (Answer: call off the barbecue.)
•	I’m really __ the summer vacation. (Answer: looking forward to the summer vacation.)
•	Could you _ me _ from the airport tomorrow? (Answer: pick me up from the airport.)
•	It’s dark in here; please __ the lights. (Answer: turn on the lights.)
•	I nearly __ on the puzzle, but then I solved it. (Answer: nearly gave up on the puzzle.)
•	We’ll __ at 7am, so be ready to leave. (Answer: We’ll set off at 7am – oh, “set off” (start a journey) wasn’t listed but is common. Or “head out”. Possibly a different phrasal needed. Given list, maybe “We’ll pick you up at 7am” if telling someone? Or "we'll leave at 7"? "Set off" is a good phrasal for journey. If not expecting that, skip.)
•	Separable or not? Rewrite these by replacing the object with a pronoun:
•	“Turn off the computer.” -> “Turn ___ off.” (Answer: Turn it off.)
•	“Find out the truth.” -> “Find ___ out.” (Trick: “find out” is inseparable in that we usually don’t split find out X with pronoun? Actually, we do say “find it out”? We usually say “find out the truth” or “find out what happened,” we don’t often do “find it out.” So likely they want no split: “Find out the truth” -> with pronoun “find it out” is technically possible but not common; better: “find out about it.” Might not test this one. Let's do another: "Pick up the phone." -> "Pick it up.")
•	“Pick up the kids.” -> “Pick ___ up.” (Answer: Pick them up.)
•	“Give up your dreams?” -> “Give ___ up?” (Answer: Give them up?)
•	“Turn on the radio.” -> “Turn ___ on.” (Answer: Turn it on.)
(Key: if pronoun, it must go in middle for separable verbs: pick them up, turn it off/on, call it off. Inseparable ones you don’t split at all (e.g., “run out of it” sounds odd, you’d rephrase).)
•	Choose the correct phrasal verb in context:
•	I need to (find out / figure out) who’s responsible for this error. (“find out” = discover who; “figure out” might imply deduce from clues. Both could fit, but likely find out who’s responsible[127].)
•	My alarm goes off at 6, but I don’t (get up / give up) until 6:30. (get up from bed.)
•	We (ran out / gave up) of paper for the printer. (ran out of paper.)
•	She (picked me up / called me off) from the station yesterday. (picked me up from the station.)
•	After years of trying, he (gave up / turned off) smoking. (gave up smoking.)
Knowing phrasal verbs comes with practice. Try to learn them in context rather than in isolation, since one phrasal verb can have multiple meanings. Don’t be afraid of them – they often use simple words, but together those words take on a new meaning. Using phrasal verbs like these will make you sound more natural and fluent, as native speakers tend to prefer them over formal Latin-based verbs in everyday conversation. For example, we more often “find out” than “discover,” “give up” than “surrender” in speech. Keep a notebook of ones you encounter and soon you’ll start “picking them up” (learning them) effortlessly!
 
These chapters covered pronunciation challenges (like TH, R, L sounds), tricky grammar points (do/does, prepositions, articles, tenses), and natural usage (idioms, phrasal verbs). Use the learning sections to understand the concepts, and the exercises to practice. With consistent practice, you’ll become more confident and fluent – speaking English like a pro. Good luck, and don't give up – learning a language is a journey, but every bit of progress is a victory. Happy learning!
